OPERATING SYSTEMS 
UNIT – 1  
A computer system is divided into two categories: Hardware and Software.  
Hardware refers to the physical and visible components of the system such as a monitor, CPU, 
keyboard and mouse.  
Software, on the other hand, refers to a set of instructions which enable the hardware to perform 
a specific set of tasks.

Introduction to Operating Systems 
An operating system (OS) is a fundamental component of a computer system that acts as an 
interface between the user and the hardware. It ensures efficient management of resources and 
provides essential services required for smooth execution of programs. Without an operating 
system, a computer would not be able to function effectively as there would be no systematic way 
to manage hardware and software interactions. 
What is an Operating System? 
An operating system is an interface between the user and the computer, facilitating communication 
and coordination between them. 
 
Definition of an Operating System 
An Operating System (OS) is a collection of software that: 
 
Manages hardware resources 
 
Provides various services to the users

Goals of an Operating System 
1. Execute user programs and make problem-solving easier – The OS provides an 
environment where user applications can run efficiently. 
2. Enhance convenience – It ensures the computer system is user-friendly and simplifies 
interactions with hardware. 
3. Optimize hardware utilization – The OS maximizes the efficiency of system resources such 
as CPU, memory, and storage. 
For example, in a multitasking environment like Windows, multiple applications such as a web 
browser, a media player, and a document editor can run simultaneously without interference, 
thanks to the OS managing the system resources effectively. 
 
 
 
Operating System Objectives 
The OS is designed to achieve several objectives that ensure smooth and efficient system 
operations. 
1. Resource Management: Manages CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices to 
optimize system performance. 
2. Abstraction: Hides hardware complexity, allowing users to interact with the system easily. 
3. Security and Protection: Implements authentication and encryption to protect system 
resources. 
4. Concurrency: Supports multitasking and multithreading for efficient process execution. 
5. User Interface: Provides graphical (GUI) or command-line (CLI) interfaces for user 
interaction.

6. Error Detection and Handling: Detects faults in hardware and software and prevents 
failures. 
7. Efficiency: Optimizes system resource utilization and minimizes response time. 
 
Operating System Views 
The operating system can be observed from the point of view of the user or the system. This is 
known as the user view and the system view respectively.  
 
User View: 
The user view depends on the system interface that is used by the users. The different types of 
user view experiences can be explained as follows − 
 
If the user is using a personal computer, the operating system is largely designed to make 
the interaction easy. Some attention is also paid to the performance of the system, but there is no 
need for the operating system to worry about resource utilization. This is because the personal 
computer uses all the resources available and there is no sharing. 
 
If the user is using a system connected to a mainframe or a minicomputer, the operating 
system is largely concerned with resource utilization. This is because there may be multiple 
terminals connected to the mainframe and the operating system makes sure that all the resources 
such as CPU, memory, I/O devices etc. are divided uniformly between them. 
 
If the user is sitting on a workstation connected to other workstations through networks, 
then the operating system needs to focus on both individual usage of resources and sharing 
though the network. This happens because the workstation exclusively uses its own resources but 
it also needs to share files etc. with other workstations across the network. 
 
If the user is using a handheld computer such as a mobile, then the operating system 
handles the usability of the device including a few remote operations. The battery level of the 
device is also taken into account. 
 
There are some devices that contain very less or no user view because there is no interaction 
with the users. Examples are embedded computers in home devices, automobiles etc. 
System View:

From the System point of view the operating system is the program which is most intermediate 
with the hardware.  
 The system views the operating system as a resource allocator. There are many resources such 
as CPU time, memory space, file storage space, I/O devices etc. that are required by processes 
for execution. It is the duty of the operating system to allocate these resources judiciously to the 
processes so that the computer system can run as smoothly as possible. 
 The operating system can also work as a control program. It manages all the processes and 
I/O devices so that the computer system works smoothly and there are no errors. It makes sure 
that the I/O devices work in a proper manner without creating problems. 
Operating System Services 
Operating system services are fundamental functionalities provided by an operating system (OS) 
to support the execution of application software.  
An Operating System provides services to both the users and to the programs. It provides 
programs, an environment to execute. It provides users, services to execute the programs in a 
convenient manner. 
Following are the services provided by operating systems to both users and to the programs:

1. User Interface 
An interface allows users to interact with the system more easily and intuitively. Many operating 
systems provide user interfaces, such as command-line interfaces (CLI), graphical user interfaces 
(GUI) and Batch Based Interface.  
 
A Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface used to interact with software and 
operating systems. Through a CLI, users can input text commands to perform specific tasks 
A GUI usually consists of all the graphical icons displayed on a computer screen, visual indicators 
like widgets, texts, labels, and text navigation. Thus, a user can directly perform actions with a 
click of the mouse or keyboard. 
A Batch-based interface in computing refers to a method of interaction between the user and the 
computer system or software where commands or a series of commands are prepared in advance 
and then exe
